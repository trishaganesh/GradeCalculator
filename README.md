# GradeCalculator
The purpose of this program is to create an array of objects to calculate the sum, difference, and average of students' quiz scores. 

For this program, there are several parts. First, we need to understand that there are two classes: the Object class and the Tester Class. 
(My program: TestGradesV10.java & TestGradesTesterV10.java

For my program, the object could be the student with two test scores. 

We will be implementing concepts learned from 6.02 and earlier on in this course (printf to format output) 
as well as the toString method, which will return a value in String format. 

The main concept is: "Array of objects", which we needed to include in our program. Essentially, we are combining all 
of these concepts to perform calculations: the sum, difference, and average of 4 students' test scores.

Area for improvement: 

Overall, I believe that I understood the program and how I could use printf to format, toString method to return a 
values in String format as well as understand how arrays of objects work. At first, I struggled with formatting and I 
felt it to be quite a tedious process. However, I was successfully able to format my calculations and output correctly. 

What I liked: 

I enjoyed writing this program because it allowed me to understand where my strengths and weaknesses lie. 
I will definitely practice this program going forward and I know this concepts will revisit me in the future.
